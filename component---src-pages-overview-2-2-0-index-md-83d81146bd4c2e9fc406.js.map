Auto-tagging adds document structure tags to the PDF file that are used to read a document's text and present it in a way that makes sense to users using assistive technology. Part of the Adobe PDF Services API offering, it is available as a REST-powered SDK with underlying Sensei AI and is easily called by automated workflows.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Automatic tagging is a good first step on a document’s journey to full accessibility. It provides significant quality improvements over untagged PDF files including more accurate results for heading levels, reading order, complex lists, links, references, and tables. Screen reader users also benefit significantly from the improvements to heading levels for navigation.The service replaces any existing tags within your document, so it provides the most benefit for PDFs that have no tags or low-quality tags. An optional Excel report generated by the PDF Accessibility Auto-Tag service provides information related to the tagging of the document and helps to find content that you might need to review or correct.`}</p>\n    <p>{`The output from the API is a tagged PDF, but it is not guaranteed to fully comply with accessibility standards such as WCAG and PDF/UA, as you may need to perform further downstream remediation and it is your responsibility to seek independent review of the same to meet those standards. After auto-tagging, to further improve accessibility, you may use Adobe Acrobat Pro to add alt-text to all figures and review the tagging of complex tables. Next you should check the first page and how the title is identified, the reading order, and then run the accessibility report, resolving any errors.`}</p>\n    <p>{`You can learn more about PDF Accessibility in `}<a parentName=\"p\" {...{\n        \"href\": \"https://www.adobe.com/accessibility/pdf/pdf-accessibility-overview.html\"\n      }}>{`this overview`}</a>{`.`}</p>\n    <h2 {...{\n      \"id\": \"community-forum-and-feedback\"\n    }}>{`Community forum and feedback`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Customer feedback is particularly valuable as it helps the team validate use cases, guide development, and troubleshoot issues.
