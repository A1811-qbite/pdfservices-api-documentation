# **Webhook Notification support for Adobe PDF Services APIs**

Webhooks are now supported in Adobe PDF Service APIs. Webhooks are the plugins which help in getting the notification of job completion. Clients will not be required to invoke the GET Status API to get the job completion status and result, instead, they will be automatically notified with the job status and result.

To use webhooks, client needs to pass **notifiers** key in the request body while invoking the Submit Job API. 
**notifiers key** expects the list of objects where each object corresponds to one webhook. Each notifier object consists of **type** and **data** fields. Below are the details of these fields and sample request :

1. **type**: Type of notifier needs to be invoked. Currently supported notifier type is [CALLBACK](#callback-notifier).
2. **data**: This contains the data needed for the webhook. It varies depending on the type of notifier.

### Sample Request Body
```json
{
  "assetID": "{{assetID}}",
  ....,
  ///REST API Operation related details
  ....
  
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "type": "<NOTIFIER_TYPE>",
      "data": {
          //<NOTIFICATION_DATA>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

<div>
Webhook notification support is only available in REST APIs. It is currently <b>not</b> supported in SDKs.
</div>

## **CALLBACK Webhook**
The callback webhook allows client to get the job completion notification on the https url. Client needs to create a HTTPS POST URL, and share that URL and related headers information in the request. Once the job completes, we create a notification payload containing the job status and output asset details and invoke the HTTP POST call on the url provided by the client.

Below are the parameters to be passed in notifier object:
1. **type** _(Required)_: It should be ***CALLBACK***.
2. **data** _(Required)_: The data keys requires below key:
   * ***url*** _(Required)_: HTTPS POST URL created by the user.
   * ***headers*** _(Optional)_: It is map of key value pair and represent headers related information required to call the URL.

### Sample Notifier Object

```json
{
  "assetID": "{{assetID}}",
  ....,
  ///REST API Operation related details
  ....
  
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "type": "CALLBACK",
      "data": {
        "url": "https://dummy.callback.org/",
        "headers": {
          "x-api-key": "dummykey",
          "access-token": "dummytoken"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Callback Payload on HTTPS URL
The notification payload sent to CALLBACK URL is same as that of **GET STATUS** response along with jobID.

#### In case Job completes with Success
In case of successful job completion, the following **callback payload** will be sent to callback url:
```json
{
  "jobID": "<JOB ID>",
  "statusResponse": {
    "status": "done",
    "asset": {
      "metadata": {
        "type": "application/pdf",
        "size": 318974
      },
      "downloadUri": "https://dcplatformstorageservice-dev-us-east-1.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/d2276912a0b243e696f124ff456be9b1_C9851F6663033A610A494128%40techacct.adobe.com/d515e6cc-4f4b-4b28-953a-7a08391df783?X-Amz-Security-Token=FwoGZXIvYXdzELz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDJJ5weJV7WO8%2FQF1HSLTAbfoqPU3TaJWlIXdHRqqFd30LHw3r6eWyLQMpESoer%2Bf%2BArqHQXr41qlrhXlocuiateFjV3wDRWxrATCXOM3Sd%2BzG4xOdPqWTlqSS4kdichFW6YxZGQWAX%2BYG4UkmsRMhqiNb0YJzibgraDjEwEdqcS%2B4jh5eVaS3FxkjbsP6IfqxUylwElwgAkplhhwv0bXel%2BoJOMcNKY0RKpjacmd5WO3heHycxTikl22H7nkN2lbgoKvD9%2Bch%2FXyaZJ16GRxUsLsJYkHMseSel3yBZa3dVNCWu4ouL%2BNqQYyLeQUtRlODiJdMXRktx%2FbQ56xDgJKRbxD%2BKTZlfH44GeCwh%2B9GJCmchbyW54NbA%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20231009T021610Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=3599&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAU5PA7W47EACOK46J%2F20231009%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=44e6060ca6bb1e70ec30b150737b4ee196acb5842efc5dd7adf05e9d1ad84074",
      "assetID": "urn:aaid:AS:UE1:786e4ea5-a720-4d0a-af6d-cb450719989c"
    }
  }
}
```

#### In case Job completes with Failure
In case of failed job completion, the following **callback payload** will be sent to callback url:
```json
{
  "jobID": "<JOB ID>",
  "statusResponse": {
    "status": "failed",
    "error": {
      "code": "INVALID_PROVIDER_NAME",
      "message": "Provider with name csctest not supported.; transactionId=c0uyOOfEtj04aWSeLiesgA6TQ4WoLc2b",
      "status": 400
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected response from client
The client should return following response payload with HTTP status code as 200 (OK):
```json
{
  "ack": "done"
}
```
<InlineAlert slots="text"/>
<div>
If the response code is not 200(OK) or expected payload is not received, then it is considered as error response. If there are 50 error response in 10 minutes then webhook notification support is blocked for that client for next 20 minutes.
