# **Webhook Notification Support for Adobe PDF Services APIs**

Adobe PDF Service APIs now integrate Webhook notifications, introducing a streamlined process for receiving job completion updates. This innovative feature eliminates the manual invocation of the GET Status API by clients to obtain job status and results. Instead, clients will automatically receive notifications containing comprehensive information about job status and results.

To harness the capabilities of webhooks, clients must incorporate the **notifiers** key in the request body when utilizing the **Submit Job** API. The **notifiers** key serves as a receptacle for a list of objects, each corresponding to a distinct webhook. Within each notifier object, two crucial fields, **type** and **data** play a pivotal role:

1. **type**: This field specifies the type of notifier to be invoked. Currently, the only supported notifier type is [CALLBACK](#callback-webhook-usage).
2. **data**: This field contains the data required for the webhook. The specific data may vary depending on the type of notifier in use.

### Sample Request Body
```json
{
  "assetID": "{{assetID}}",
  ....,
  ///REST API Operation related details
  ....
  
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "type": "<NOTIFIER_TYPE>",
      "data": {
          //<NOTIFICATION_DATA>
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Webhook notification support is only available in REST APIs. It is currently <b>not</b> supported in SDKs.
</div>

## **Callback Webhook Usage**
The callback webhook feature facilitates the clients to receive real-time notifications on job completion through a designated HTTPS URL. To use this feature, clients must establish an HTTPS POST URL, sharing it alongside essential header information in their request. Upon successful job completion, a notification payload is dynamically generated, encompassing comprehensive details about the job status and output assets. This payload is then transmitted via an HTTP POST request to the client-specified URL.

### Parameters for the Notifier Object
When implementing the callback webhook, the notifier object necessitates the inclusion of specific parameters:
1. **type** _(Required)_: This field should always be set to ***CALLBACK***.
2. **data** _(Required)_: The "data" field contains the following keys:
   * ***url*** _(Required)_: The user-crafted HTTPS POST URL.
   * ***headers*** _(Optional)_: This optional field, a map of key-value pairs, encompasses header-related information vital for the URL call. While not obligatory, it offers the flexibility to provide additional context or authentication for the callback.

### Sample Notifier Object

```json
{
  "assetID": "{{assetID}}",
  ....,
  ///REST API Operation related details
  ....
  
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "type": "CALLBACK",
      "data": {
        "url": "https://dummy.callback.org/",
        "headers": {
          "x-api-key": "dummykey",
          "access-token": "dummytoken"
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### Callback Payload on HTTPS URL
The notification payload sent to CALLBACK URL is same as that of **GET STATUS** response along with jobID.

#### In case Job completes with Success
In case of successful job completion, the following **callback payload** will be sent to callback url:
```json
{
  "jobID": "<JOB ID>",
  "statusResponse": {
    "status": "done",
    "asset": {
      "metadata": {
        "type": "application/pdf",
        "size": 318974
      },
      "downloadUri": "https://dcplatformstorageservice-dev-us-east-1.s3-accelerate.amazonaws.com/d2276912a0b243e696f124ff456be9b1_C9851F6663033A610A494128%40techacct.adobe.com/d515e6cc-4f4b-4b28-953a-7a08391df783?X-Amz-Security-Token=FwoGZXIvYXdzELz%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2F%2FwEaDJJ5weJV7WO8%2FQF1HSLTAbfoqPU3TaJWlIXdHRqqFd30LHw3r6eWyLQMpESoer%2Bf%2BArqHQXr41qlrhXlocuiateFjV3wDRWxrATCXOM3Sd%2BzG4xOdPqWTlqSS4kdichFW6YxZGQWAX%2BYG4UkmsRMhqiNb0YJzibgraDjEwEdqcS%2B4jh5eVaS3FxkjbsP6IfqxUylwElwgAkplhhwv0bXel%2BoJOMcNKY0RKpjacmd5WO3heHycxTikl22H7nkN2lbgoKvD9%2Bch%2FXyaZJ16GRxUsLsJYkHMseSel3yBZa3dVNCWu4ouL%2BNqQYyLeQUtRlODiJdMXRktx%2FbQ56xDgJKRbxD%2BKTZlfH44GeCwh%2B9GJCmchbyW54NbA%3D%3D&X-Amz-Algorithm=AWS4-HMAC-SHA256&X-Amz-Date=20231009T021610Z&X-Amz-SignedHeaders=host&X-Amz-Expires=3599&X-Amz-Credential=ASIAU5PA7W47EACOK46J%2F20231009%2Fus-east-1%2Fs3%2Faws4_request&X-Amz-Signature=44e6060ca6bb1e70ec30b150737b4ee196acb5842efc5dd7adf05e9d1ad84074",
      "assetID": "urn:aaid:AS:UE1:786e4ea5-a720-4d0a-af6d-cb450719989c"
    }
  }
}
```

#### In case Job completes with Failure
In case of failed job completion, the following **callback payload** will be sent to callback url:
```json
{
  "jobID": "<JOB ID>",
  "statusResponse": {
    "status": "failed",
    "error": {
      "code": "INVALID_PROVIDER_NAME",
      "message": "Provider with name csctest not supported.; transactionId=c0uyOOfEtj04aWSeLiesgA6TQ4WoLc2b",
      "status": 400
    }
  }
}
```

## Expected response from client
The client is expected to return the following response payload with an HTTP status code of 200 (OK):
```json
{
  "ack": "done"
}
```
<InlineAlert slots="text"/>
<div>
If the response code is not 200 (OK) or the expected payload is not received, it will be considered an error response. In the event of 50 error responses within a 10-minute period, webhook notification support will be temporarily blocked for that client for the next 20 minutes.
